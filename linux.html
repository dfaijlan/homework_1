                    Linux is a Unix-like computer operating system that is considered <br />
                    to be under the model of free and open-source software development <br />
                    and distribution. The defining component of Linux is the Linux <br />
                    kernel, which was released 25 years ago on September 17, 1991 <br />
                    by Linus Torvalds. While trailing behind Windows and MacOS as the <br />
                    third most used Operating System, it is considered to be the leading <br />
                    operating system used on servers and other big iron systems such <br />
                    as mainframe computers. The underlying source code of Linux <br />
                    may be used, modified, and distributed, whether it be commercially <br />
                    or non-commercially. <br /> <br />
