                    MacOS, previously known as Mac OS X and later OS X, is a family <br />
                    of Unix-based graphical operating systems developed and maintained <br />
                    by Apple Inc. It is designed to run on Apple's brand of personal <br />
                    computers called a Macintosh, or Mac for short. It is currently <br />
                    the second most used operating system after Microsoft Windows. <br />
                    MacOS originally launched in 2001, which superseded the "classic" <br />
                    Mac Os, which launched in 1984. This OS has been preinstalled <br />
                    on all Macs since 2002. <br /> <br />
